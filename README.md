## üéØ About The Project

This program allows the user to get measured data from a BME680 sensor üå° and send them in MQTT messages üì¨ via a TLS session to an MQTT Broker (in this case AWS IoT Core). All of this is done in Rust ü¶Ä without the use of the standard library. The program uses the [ESP32S3-BOX](https://github.com/espressif/esp-box/blob/master/docs/hardware_overview/esp32_s3_box/hardware_overview_for_box.md) Devkit.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîå Hardware Setup

Before running the program, make sure your hardware is properly set up.

1. **Connect the BME680 Sensor to ESP32S3-BOX device:**
   - SDA to G41 on the device
   - SCL to G40 on the device
   - 2-5V to 3v3 on the device
   - GND to GND on the device
   > All 4 wires should be next to each other in the end.
   
2. **Connect the ESP32S3-BOX to your computer**:
   - Use a USB-C cable to establish the connection.

### üì∂ WiFi Setup and Program Execution

To set up your WiFi credentials and execute the program, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Use the Script üìú

1. **Edit the Script**: Open `run_with_wifi_credentials.sh` and enter your WiFi SSID and PASSWORD.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to set the environment variables and run the program.
    ```bash
    ./run_with_wifi_credentials.sh
    ```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup ü§ñ

1. **Export Environment Variables**: Manually set the environment variables for your WiFi credentials.
    ```bash
    export SSID=your_wifi_ssid
    export PASSWORD=your_wifi_password
    ```
2. **Run the Program**: Use the following command to run the program.
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```

Choose one of these options to set up your WiFi and execute the program.
